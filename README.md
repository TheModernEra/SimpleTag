# SimpleTag
A Minecraft Bukkit plugin for a simple game of tag.

# Why make this? It's dead simple.
This was originally made for the purpose of teaching kids the fundamentals of plugin development. Main concepts tackled in this project include commands,
event listeners, boolean toggles, and chat coloring. 

# How to use it
To compile, download this repo, open it in Eclipse or IntelliJ. Run as Maven Install and it will compile. If you would just like to try the plugin, I've made a release containing just the .jar file.
